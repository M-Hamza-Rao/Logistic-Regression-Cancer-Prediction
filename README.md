# Logistic Regression Cancer Prediction
This project uses Logistic Regression, a fundamental classification algorithm in machine learning, to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on features extracted from medical data. The dataset used is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, a well-known dataset in the field of medical data analysis and machine learning.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
Main.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing all data processing, visualization, model training, and evaluation steps.

(Optional additions):

requirements.txt: Python dependencies for setting up the environment.

data/: Directory where the dataset resides or is downloaded.

ðŸ§  Model Used
Logistic Regression (from sklearn.linear_model)

Binary classification: Predicts Malignant or Benign.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset

Features: Mean, standard error, and worst measurements of radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

Target: diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

ðŸ“ˆ Workflow Overview
Data Import and Exploration

Load the dataset using pandas

Check for null values and understand the distribution of classes

Data Preprocessing

Encode categorical variables (M/B to 1/0)

Standardize features using StandardScaler

Split dataset into training and test sets

Model Training

Fit a Logistic Regression model on the training data

Model Evaluation

Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Visualize results using seaborn and matplotlib

Conclusion

Discussion of model performance and limitations

âœ… Results
Achieved high accuracy on both training and test datasets

Strong separation between malignant and benign classes

Demonstrated that logistic regression is effective for binary classification tasks in healthcare data

ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
